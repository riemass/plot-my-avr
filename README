# Plot data from Arduino

Simple, prototye project, just to prove a point.

Reads /dev/ttyACM0, runs a small server and sends data to localhost:40080,
where you can find a plot of the values.

./avr folder has a small example that sends a random value via UART every 500ms.
./src holds the desktop part

# Dependencies

[crow](https://github.com/ipkn/crow) - added via git submodule
boost algorithm - needed by crow
[peity](https://github.com/benpickles/peity) - jquery plugin for plotting, copy-pasted in html

Kudos to all developers!
